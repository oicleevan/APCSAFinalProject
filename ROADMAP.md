# ROADMAP

## short term

- ~~implement admin account that can access other users (change password, delete account, etc.)~~ (**REMOVED, thought it was pointless**)

## long term

- ~~file management (saving all accounts/emails to file) so that things save between runs~~ (**DONE!**)

- event logger, save to file?

- find way to run on website/host on server, make actually kinda accessible email server?
