# my email server

## what is it?

computer science project. i decided to make an email system in java for a project.

### you can...

- create accounts!
- read emails!
- send emails!

check out the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## running

once i've completed the project i will provide a `.jar` executable that can be run automatically in a terminal, but for now you have to compile.

if you download the source, i've provided a `start.sh` script that will automatically compile (using ant) and start the app. you have to make it executable with `chmod +x ./start.sh`. 

## compiling from source

- ```git clone https://github.com/oicleevan/APCSAFinalProject```
- ```cd APCSAFinalProject```
- ```ant package```


(you could then run with `start.sh`)

## attributions

all code by me. written on vscode and compiled using ant on an ubuntu wsl vm (at least for me).
